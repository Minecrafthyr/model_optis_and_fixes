## Variants

Lite < Full(no suffix) < Textured < Extra < Extra with 3D Default

- "Lite" variant  
  Consistent with Default resource look, fixes only.
- "Full" variant (Default download)  
  Visually improve item models or display.  
  You can use [Respackopts](https://modrinth.com/mod/TiF5QWZY) mod config this and downside variant.
- "Textured" variant  
  Using texture may conflict to other resourcepack.  
  Designed works with Default resources.
- "Extra" variant  
  Contains significant visual changes that I subjectively believe are better, not normal fixes.
- "Extra with 3D Default" variant  
  Embedded GeForceLegend's [3D Default](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/3d-default) with compatibility tweaks.
