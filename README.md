## Variants

Lite < Full(no suffix) < Textured < Extra < External

Full is Primary file. Download variants in additional files or [Github Source](https://github.com/Minecrafthyr/model_optis_and_fixes/tree/main/Zipped).

- Lite variant  
  Consistent with Default resource look, fixes only.
- Full variant  
  Visually improve item models or display.  
  Config use [Respackopts](https://modrinth.com/mod/TiF5QWZY) mod (not suggested, it just disable files).
- Textured variant  
  Using texture may conflict to other resourcepack.  
  Designed works with Default resources.
- Extra variant  
  Contains significant visual changes that I subjectively believe are better, not normal fixes, see [Modrinth Gallery](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/model-optimizations-and-fixes/gallery).
- External variant  
  Include and tweaks with external pack.  
  Embedded GeForceLegend's [3D Default](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/3d-default).
