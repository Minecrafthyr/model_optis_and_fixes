# Resource Fixes

Optimize block models and fix bugs in Default vanilla resources.

- Project Links:
  - [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/xq2isoUl)
  - [Github](https://github.com/Minecrafthyr/model_optis_and_fixes)
- Old name: Model Optimizations and Fixes
- (May contains errors. Some bugs can't be fix by resourepack.)

### Suggestions / Compatibilities

- [Enhanced Block Entities](https://modrinth.com/mod/ebe) mod
- [Model Gap Fix](https://modrinth.com/mod/modelfix) (or [Stfu](https://modrinth.com/mod/shuttfup)) mod
- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) mod

## Variants

Download in Modrinth: [Version](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/xq2isoUl/version/6.0) => Files

Lite < Full(no suffix) < Textured < Extra

- "Lite" variant  
  Consistent with Default resource look, fixes only.
- "Full" variant (Default download)  
  Visually improve item models or display.  
  You can use [Respackopts](https://modrinth.com/mod/TiF5QWZY) mod config this and downside variant.
- "Textured" variant  
  Using texture may conflict to other resourcepack.  
  Should be work in vanilla.
- "Extra" variant  
  Contains significant visual changes that I subjectively believe are better, not normal fixes.

### Extra

3D (Blocks)

- Ladder
- Rails
- Pointed Dripstone (for matching texture, model is bigger than collision box)

Animation

- Animation of flowing lava is now faster then still lava.
- Kelp animation is slower.

Better Cross

- Centered Fern.

Block States

- Visualize Farmland "moisture" state 0 - 7.
- Visualize Leaves "waterlogged" state.
- Redstone Ore is darker on unlit state.

Consistent Planes

- Sore plane-like models are now not floating, shadeless, has cullface.

Fire

- Fire texture is a bit transparent on body (it's cutout on block because of render type).
- Sides of floor fire is lower than before (center has not changes).

Shadeless Lights

- Light source blocks are shadeless and use front GUI light. ([MC-296027](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-296027 "Certain Light-Emitting Blocks Lack Internal Glow in Java Edition"))

Wide Bamboo

- 4 pixel wide Bamboo.
- Wider bamboo leaves ([MC-262691](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC/issues/MC-262691)).
